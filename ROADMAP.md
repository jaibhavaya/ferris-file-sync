- [ ] Implement single-file processing from SQS
- [ ] Add message visibility management

### Iteration 3.4: Queue-Based Processing
- [ ] Create worker loop for continuous SQS polling
- [ ] Add concurrency control for queue processing
- [ ] Implement dead-letter queue handling
- [ ] Add metrics collection for queue operations

### Iteration 3.5: HTTP to Queue Bridge
- [ ] Modify HTTP endpoints to enqueue tasks
- [ ] Return immediate acknowledgment with task ID
- [ ] Add webhook capability for completion notification
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with direct API

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Iteration 4.1: Metadata Preservation
- [ ] Preserve file creation/modification times
- [ ] Handle custom metadata attributes
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Add support for file versioning

### Iteration 4.2: Batch Operations

- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical failures

### Iteration 4.5: Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Create simple admin interface
- [ ] Add customer management capabilities

## Testing Checkpoints

After each iteration, verify:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions work as expected
2. **Integration Tests**: Components work together properly
3. **Manual Testing**: End-to-end functionality with real services
4. **Error Cases**: System handles failures gracefully
5. **Performance**: System meets speed and resource usage targets

## Decision Points

Consider these decision points along the way:

1. After Phase 2: Evaluate database choice based on actual usage patterns
2. After Phase 3: Decide on scaling strategy (vertical vs. horizontal)
3. After Phase 4: Determine if additional features are needed before optimization
4. Throughout: Adjust prioritization based on user feedback and requirements
