- [ ] Implement chunked download from S3
- [ ] Implement chunked upload to OneDrive
- [ ] Handle progress tracking during transfer

### Iteration 2.3: Improved Error Handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Add proper error logging with context
- [ ] Create structured error responses
- [ ] Implement graceful service shutdown

### Iteration 2.4: Concurrent Transfers
- [ ] Implement task-based concurrency with Tokio
- [ ] Add throttling mechanisms based on resources
- [ ] Create connection pooling for database
- [ ] Test with multiple simultaneous file transfers

### Iteration 2.5: Queue Management
- [ ] Implement message visibility management
- [ ] Add dead-letter queue handling
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed transfers
- [ ] Add metrics collection for queue operations

## Phase 3: Multi-Tenant & Advanced Features

### Iteration 3.1: Multi-Tenant Support
- [ ] Extend database schema for customer-specific data
- [ ] Update authentication flow to store customer context
- [ ] Add customer isolation for file operations
- [ ] Implement customer token refresh management

### Iteration 3.2: Metadata Preservation
- [ ] Preserve file creation/modification times
- [ ] Handle custom metadata attributes
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Add support for file versioning

### Iteration 3.3: Batch Operations
- [ ] Implement directory/folder synchronization
- [ ] Add batch upload/download capabilities
- [ ] Create efficient change detection
- [ ] Support recursive operations

### Iteration 3.4: S3 Event Integration
- [ ] Set up S3 event notifications
- [ ] Create event processor for automatic syncing
- [ ] Implement filtering by path/extension
- [ ] Add real-time sync capabilities

### Iteration 3.5: Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add metrics collection (transfer rates, failures)
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical failures

## Phase 4: Scaling & Optimization

### Iteration 4.1: Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark different file sizes and types
- [ ] Optimize concurrency parameters
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [ ] Profile and optimize resource usage

### Iteration 4.2: High Availability
- [ ] Design for multi-instance deployment
- [ ] Implement distributed locking if needed
- [ ] Add instance health monitoring
- [ ] Create automated failover mechanisms

### Iteration 4.3: Security Enhancements
- [ ] Audit and improve authentication security
- [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Add access control for administrative functions
- [ ] Conduct security review

### Iteration 4.4: Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Create deployment templates
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document operations procedures

### Iteration 4.5: Documentation & Handover
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Write system architecture documentation
- [ ] Develop troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Prepare training materials

## Testing Checkpoints

After each iteration, verify:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions work as expected
2. **Integration Tests**: Components work together properly
3. **Manual Testing**: End-to-end functionality with real services
4. **Error Cases**: System handles failures gracefully
5. **Performance**: System meets speed and resource usage targets

## Decision Points

Consider these decision points along the way:

1. After Phase 1: Evaluate message format and structure based on actual needs
2. After Phase 2: Decide on scaling strategy (vertical vs. horizontal)
3. After Phase 3: Determine if additional features are needed before optimization
4. Throughout: Adjust prioritization based on user feedback and requirements
